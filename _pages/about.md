Yanpeng Gong joined the Institute of Electronics Packaging Technology and Reliability (IEPTR) of Beijing University of Technology in 2022, as an associate Professor. Before this, he was a lecturer in IEPTR for three years (2019-2022). In 2019, he graduated in Mechanics with a Ph.D. from Beijing Institute of Technology under the guidance of Professor Chunying Dong. His thesis concentrated on applications of the isogeometric boundary element methods (IGABEM) to heat transfer problems, inclusion problmes and coatings. In 2017-2018, as an exchanging visiting Ph.D. student, he was at the School of Engineering and Computing of Durham University under the support of Professor Jon Trevelyan on isogeometric boundary element methods with applications to coatings.  

In 2022, he was awarded Humboldt Research Fellowship for Postdocs with the host Prof. Xiaoying Zhuang. Between 2023-2025, he is at the Institute of Photonics of Leibniz University Hannover and will conduct his research on numerical methods for the interface fracture in flexoelectric nanostructures.
