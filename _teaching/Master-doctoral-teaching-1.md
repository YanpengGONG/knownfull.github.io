This course is for master and doctoral students majoring in mechanics and mechanical engineering. The introduction to Abaqus covers basic modeling using Abaqus/CAE and linear and nonlinear applications, such as large deformation, plasticity, contact, and dynamics using Abaqus/Standard and Abaqus/Explicit. Advanced contents cover topics of interest to students with experience using Abaqus, such as engine analysis, fracture mechanics, heat transfer, and the Abaqus scripting interface. This course also describes how you use the Abaqus Scripting Interface and the python application programming interface to access an Abaqus output database. Students taking this course will learn the theory of Abaqus and how to solve mechanics problems such as heat transfer problems, fluid problems, electrical problems and multi-physics coupling problems. The contents of this course not only include the fundamental theory of finite element method, but also theory of Python language, Python scripting interface for Abaqus and Post-processing by Python scripting.
